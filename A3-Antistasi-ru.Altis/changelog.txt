- Shoot your enemies head to see another feature.
- Punishment changed from hitting players to killing players. As the killed player is in unconscious state, it is very difficult to kill a player by non negligent accident.

10/06/13 0.14.1 Alpha

25/11/15 0.17.0 Alpha
- NEW FEATURE: NAPALM and cluster bombs.
- NEW FEATURE: NATO Bomb Runs. For 10 NATO points you have three options for bomb run: HE, Cluster and Napalm bombs.
- NEW FEATURE: Guard Dogs. They will reveal (by smell, no matter if on sight) any close barefoot FIA, no matter if undercover or not. They have some chance to spawn in Roadblocks, Resources, Powerplants, Airports and Bases. ISSUE: AI won't attack them, they love the Altis puppies. Humans will have to kill them by themselves.
- NEW FEATURE: Added some guerrilla uniforms, caps, bandanas etc.. to the initial Arsenal stuff for those players who want to play Barbie.
- IMPORTANT: You won't loose Undercover on foot by proximity (the dogs are the exception).
- IMPORTANT: CSAT and NATO now can attack other zones than bases, airports and cities. They will not use arty and/or bomb runs in those zones.
- IMPORTANT: NATO CAS Missions now may consist of up to three vehicles. Number and quality still depend on how much support the FIA has.
- IMPORTANT: Petros is not included in the spawning system which gives, in some cases, a performance boost. Near HQ vehicles will despawn if more than 300 mts away.
- IMPORTANT: Dogs in cities. But don't worry. They are just furniture. Or not....
- IMPORTANT: FIA mortar fire may lead to a S&D AAF patrol in the surroundings, simulating a mission to destroy the battery.
- IMPORTANT: Added some comments in initVar.sqf and initZones.sqf for the few braves who dare to try to modify Antistasi or try to make it work in custom islands.
- IMPORTANT: An FPS check will be done before performing lots of actions. Specially spawning units. AAF garrisons will stop spawning when a minimum is done (mainly building and static weapon groups). Players won't be able to recruit or ask NATO anything if the server is too loaded. Exceptions: FIA garrisons (not NATO!!!), basic AAF garrisons, sidemission units, small counterattacks. Big ones will be just delayed but won't spawn less units. Some other processes in the game will be bypassed when the check fails, such as the surrender script. If you want to disable this (and burn your server maybe) just put your FPS limit on a lower setting. Mission will allow you to set it on zero, and have a full Antistasi no matter what.
- Reworked CSAT and AAF surrendering code, better performance.
- NATO Air attacks will only consist on transport vehicles, as player can provide CAS and Bomb Runs separately.
- CSAT will use proper ammo types in their bomb runs.
- Reworked Persistent Save and destroyed buildings, it wasn't working after a second Load.
- Added some ACO optics to the possible Arsenal asstets. Added IR beams to AAF ammoboxes.

- Surrendered units won't generate traffic in the network.
- Defend HQ missions by mortar fire were not spawning properly in MP
- Now players can add Air and other types (no NATO) of vehicles to the garage pool.
- In City Supplies missions, in MP, undercover near track units were not loosing undercover. Solved.

- Corrected: FIA soldiers were spawning with AT weapons with no ammo.
- Civilian defense in CSAT punishments is now spawned instead of picking them from the already spawned civs. Minimum of 8, their number depends on % Civ spawning rate, population and FIA support. Very untrained.
- Militia with GL ifles will spawn with 3 HE grenades.
26/11/15 0.17.1 Alpha

- Simulation disenablement was set to HQ vehicles instead of the others. Performance improvement.
- Doubled HR gain on Tax Income.
- Corrected small bug in Prisoner Rescue missions and doubled the HR income for success, as it is the hardest mission in Antistasi.
- Removed helmet removal upon headshot in MP (less traffic).
30/11/15 0.17.3 Alpha
- IMPORTANT: Dramatically, very dramatically decreased recruit AI pricing costs for both FIA and AAF as they were too high on top skill levels. Its supposed to be around 2xprice in skill level 20. This will make to see more Tanks, planes etc.. on AAF side, and "early" MP players will be able to recruit something on high skill servers.
- IMPORTANT: Nerfed a much more AAF skills. It should be much more noticeable on the early stages.
- IMPORTANT: Ignoring a "Kill the Traitor" mission will lead to a big loss on HR and money, instead of a "Defend Petros" mission. Failing it (Traitor reaches an AAF base) stays the same.
- Version is shown in hint when the player selects Game Options menu.
- AutoRearm: AI will pick magazines for secondary weapons from dead soldiers backpack, not only the empty backpack.
- Persistent Save message won't spawn in the middle of the screen.

- Included Huron transport and appropiate cargo soldiers on NATO Attacks.
- AA Threat evaluation implemented for any air assault. If there is too much threat, squads will be mostly paradropped on high altitude, if there is low risk, then rappel or simple disembark will be done. Not for all types of choppers.
- Door animations to all vehicles (that have). You can now shoot into the APC/Heli while it has the doors opened.
- Excluded HQ Ammobox from the AI AutoRearm function.

- Safer and nicer garage vehicle selection.
- Fancy task markers are back (lost due to procedure changes in the last Nexus Uodate)
- Corrected transfer cargo script when the ammobox had too few items it didn't worked.

- First Aid Kits no longer available in Arsenal from the begining.
06/12/15 0.17.5 Alpha
- IMPORTANT: City Road DB was traveling around the network A LOT. Reworked the Cities Road DB to be totally server sided. This should increase a bit network performance in MP. This is a very core change, heavily tested, but may lead to severe malfunctions, please report any issue you find.
- IMPORTANT: To adapt to the new stamina system, FIA grunt loadout will check for what weight the unit has in order to add a launcher. Same with AutoRearm: They won't search for a launcher if they are too loaded.
- IMPORTANT: Total rework on Undercover mode. Now player has to click the proper button un Y menu. On foot: A civilian uniform is required. When Undercover is lost in some cases, the player or it's vehicle will be reported, and the vehicle may become un usable or the player will need to wait for 30 in game minutes to be able to become Undercover again. Check briefing notes for details.
- IMPORTANT: Planting mines while undercover will make a check of enemy presence and, if in city, AAF civ support (simulating reported by an AAF supported civ) to lose Undercover.
- Stealing civilian vehicles will affect prestige in the respective city and, depending on city suport, maybe the AAF will be reported of players position and / or lose undercover.
- Liberating POWS/Refugees makes the player lose Undercover (if not, some missions would become extremely easy).
- Due to new Undercover system civilian uniforms have been added to the Arsenal.
- Small change on button distribution in Y menu. Dismiss units is now in AI Management menu.
- Corrected bug in some rare cases with the arsenal update and player placed preconfigured weapons.

- IMPORTANT: Garrison system extended to Bases and Airports. NATO presence and vehicles now depends on NATO support (there is allways at leas one squad).
